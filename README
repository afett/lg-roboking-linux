This repo contains the "sanitized" sources of GPL/kernel-2.6.33 directory
from the VR6XXX_OpenSource_v1.3.1.zip released by LG[1].

This repo was build using the following steps:

1. unpack VR6XXX_OpenSource_v1.3.1.zip
2. clone the linux-rt stable tree from [2]
3. create branch 'lg-oss' from tag v2.6.33.7.2-rt30 which is the version in the toplevel kernel Makefile in the LG sources
4. remove all files and directories on that branch
5. copy all files and directories from the GPL/kernel-2.6.33 directory of the LG sources to the repo
6. commit all changes on branch lg-oss as a single to the repo
7. create a new branch 'lg-oss-patches' from 'lg-oss'
8. reset toplevel commit and split it up in multiple commits
9. create a new branch lg-2.6.33.7.2-rt30 from tag v2.6.33.7.2-rt30
10. cherry pick selected commits from lg-oss-patches to lg-2.6.33.7.2-rt30 omitting whitespace errors and a couple merge errors
11. delete the master branch of the repo
12. rename lg-2.6.33.7.2-rt30 to master
